                <p className="text-sm text-justify">I am a software developer with a passion for engineering and a knack for simplifying complex tasks. With a background in CNC machining and programming, over the years I have developed strong analytical and problem solving skills, and the ability to come up with effective solutions both in and outside the box. I feel most accomplished when I create solutions that make processess more efficient either by eliminating and centralizing operations through code or by analyzing operations, identifying patterns and creating parameterized code usuable for a range of input values.</p>
                <p className="text-sm text-justify">Thank you for taking an interest in my work and for taking the time to review my portfolio. </p>
